Google::SAMLResponse - Generate signed XML documents as SAMLResponses for Google's SSO implementation

Google::SAMLResponse can be used to generate a signed
xml document that is needed for logging your users into
Google using SSO.

For example, you have some sort of application that authenticates
users such as a web application. Your users should be able to use
some sort of Google service such as Google mail. Now when using
SSO with your Google partner account, Google will redirect users
to a URL that you can define. Behind this URL, you can have a script
that can authenticate users in your original framework, generate
a SAMLResponse for Google that you send to your users who then
submit it to Google. If everything works, users will then be logged
into a Google account and they don't even have to know their usernames
or passwords.

See perldoc Google::SAMLResponse for details.
